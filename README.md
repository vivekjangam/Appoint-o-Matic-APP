**** Appoint-o-Matic APP

Recently when I worked in many firms, I realised that many small businesses still uses excel as their primary tool and VBA as programming language of it. But Excel have its limitations and to grow in business we must evolve to advance tech. Python is one stop solution for that. I created this app in such a creative way that it integrates excel functionality with python and perform extra-excel tasks which excel can not do. Isn’t it interesting that we can use UI in excel created by basic shapes and send data as an argument to python code and perform tasks like web scraping and Automation.
